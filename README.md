## FileGuardian:Autonomous-Defense-Framework-For-Cryptographic-Ransomware-Using-BiLSTM-And-Proactive-Data-Protection
File Guardian is an intelligent, proactive cybersecurity framework designed to detect and prevent ransomware attacks using deep learning and encryption. 
## About
File Guardian is a comprehensive, AI-driven cybersecurity project aimed at real-time detection and proactive defense against ransomware attacks. Traditional security systems fall short against modern ransomware due to their reliance on known signatures. File Guardian solves this issue using a combination of advanced deep learning (BiLSTM) and cryptographic techniques (Format Preserving Encryption) to identify, block, and neutralize ransomware threats before they cause any harm.
The system consists of multiple modules including a web interface for users/admins (RanFooler Tool), a training engine for malware detection, a real-time prediction model, and a data protection module that conceals sensitive files from ransomware encryption.
## 🌟 Features
🔐 Real-Time Ransomware Detection using BiLSTM-based deep learning models.

🛡️ Data Protection via Format Preserving Encryption (FPE).

🧠 Machine Learning-Based Classification of ransomware vs benign software.

📊 Simulated Attack Testing through RanFooler Web Tool.

🖥️ Admin & User Interfaces for custom configurations and monitoring.

🔁 Continuous Monitoring and Automated Alerts for active threats.
