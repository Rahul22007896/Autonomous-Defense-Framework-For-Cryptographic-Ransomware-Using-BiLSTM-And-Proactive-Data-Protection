##🚀FileGuardian-Autonomous-Defense-Framework-For-Cryptographic-Ransomware-Using-BiLSTM-And-Proactive-Data-Protection
File Guardian is an intelligent, proactive cybersecurity framework designed to detect and prevent ransomware attacks using deep learning and encryption. 
## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Tailored Chatbot for Hostel Booking System is a project designed to integrate a chatbot that leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries to the hostel booking system. Traditional hostel booking processes are often time-consuming and involve manual searches and extensive communication with hostel staff. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by creating an easy-to-use chatbot interface that assists students in addressing inquiries.
